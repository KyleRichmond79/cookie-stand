    <p>Pat's salmon cookies were originally entered into a cooking competition
      for the 2013 Ballard Locks "Salmon SEEson" opener. Pat took first place and
      was given such high praise for her salmon cookie she decided to turn it into
      business.</p>

    <p>Pat's first Cookie Stand opened up in Pike's Place Market in 2014. There are
      now 5 stores and looking to expand. If you are interested in helping Pat find
      new locations please feel free to <a href="http://www.yahoomail.com/">email</a> her.</p>
